    "abs1 = 'How learning enhances neural representations for behaviorally relevant stimuli via activity changes of cortical cell types remains unclear. We simultaneously imaged responses of pyramidal cells (PYR) along with parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) inhibitory interneurons in primary visual cortex while mice learned to discriminate visual patterns. Learning increased selectivity for task-relevant stimuli of PYR, PV and SOM subsets but not VIP cells. Strikingly, PV neurons became as selective as PYR cells, and their functional interactions reorganized, leading to the emergence of stimulus-selective PYR–PV ensembles. Conversely, SOM activity became strongly decorrelated from the network, and PYR–SOM coupling before learning predicted selectivity increases in individual PYR cells. Thus, learning differentially shapes the activity and interactions of multiple cell classes: while SOM inhibition may gate selectivity changes, PV interneurons become recruited into stimulus-specific ensembles and provide more selective inhibition as the network becomes better at discriminating behaviorally relevant stimuli.'"

    "abs2 = 'There is a need for new therapeutic targets with which to prevent Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a major contributor to aging-related cognitive decline. Here we report the construction and validation of a molecular network of the aging human frontal cortex. Using RNA sequence data from 478 individuals, we first build a molecular network using modules of coexpressed genes and then relate these modules to AD and its neuropathologic and cognitive endophenotypes. We confirm these associations in two independent AD datasets. We also illustrate the use of the network in prioritizing amyloid- and cognition-associated genes for in vitro validation in human neurons and astrocytes. These analyses based on unique cohorts enable us to resolve the role of distinct cortical modules that have a direct effect on the accumulation of AD pathology from those that have a direct effect on cognitive decline, exemplifying a network approach to complex diseases.'"

    "abs3 = 'Delay discounting (DD), the tendency to discount the value of delayed versus current rewards, is elevated in a constellation of diseases and behavioral conditions. We performed a genome-wide association study of DD using 23,127 research participants of European ancestry. The most significantly associated single-nucleotide polymorphism was rs6528024 (P = 2.40 × 10−8), which is located in an intron of the gene GPM6B. We also showed that 12% of the variance in DD was accounted for by genotype and that the genetic signature of DD overlapped with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, major depression, smoking, personality, cognition and body weight.'"

    "abs4 = 'Delta-secretase cleaves both APP and Tau to mediate the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, how aging contributes to an increase in delta-secretase expression and AD pathologies remains unclear. Here we show that a CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ), an inflammation-regulated transcription factor, acts as a key age-dependent effector elevating both delta-secretase (AEP) and inflammatory cytokines expression in mediating pathogenesis in AD mouse models. We find that C/EBPβ regulates delta-secretase transcription and protein levels in an age-dependent manner. Overexpression of C/EBPβ in young 3xTg mice increases delta-secretase and accelerates the pathological features including cognitive dysfunctions, which is abolished by inactive AEP C189S. Conversely, depletion of C/EBPβ from old 3xTg or 5XFAD mice diminishes delta-secretase and reduces AD pathologies, leading to amelioration of cognitive impairment in these AD mouse models. Thus, our findings support that C/EBPβ plays a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis via increasing delta-secretase expression.'"
